# The Time Stone: Lets get cosmic here and begin working with Time.
## First, lets create a function that converts Minutes to Seconds (1 ->60, 5 -> 300)
## Then take it up a step further, converting Hours into seconds (1 -> 3600)
## We're on the right track here, how many seconds are in a day?
## Bonus -> Without singing the old showtune in your head, how many Minutes are there in a year? 
## In days, in weeks, in cups of coffee?



# Hide the credit card number
### Write a function in Python that accepts a credit card number. It should return a string where all the characters are hidden with an asterisk except the last four. For example, if the function gets sent "1234567894444", then it should return "*********4444".




# Give me the discount
## Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first should be the full price of an item as an integer. The second should be the discount percentage as an integer.

## The function should return the price of the item after the discount has been applied. For example, if the price is 100 and the discount is 20, the function should return 80.
